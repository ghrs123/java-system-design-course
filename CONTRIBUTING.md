# Contributing to Java System Design Course

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This project focuses on production-grade system design using Java.
Contributions must maintain technical depth and architectural rigor.

---

## 🎯 Contribution Principles

1. Focus on real-world engineering.
2. Avoid interview-only superficial explanations.
3. Always include trade-offs.
4. Provide runnable Java examples when possible.
5. Include exercises AND solutions.
6. Respect the module template structure.

---

## 📂 Module Structure Requirement

Every module must follow the official template located at:

[docs/module-template.md](docs/module-template.md)

Required files:

- theory.md
- exercises.md
- solutions.md
- project.md
- /code (if applicable)

Use [docs/module-template/module-skeleton/](docs/module-template/module-skeleton/) when creating a new module.

Pull requests that do not follow the structure will be rejected.

## 🧠 Technical Depth Requirements

Contributions must:

- Explain internal mechanics.
- Cover failure scenarios.
- Include performance considerations.
- Include cost implications when relevant.
- Discuss trade-offs clearly.

Avoid:

- Generic definitions.
- Copy-pasted blog content.
- Pure theory without implementation.

---

## 🧪 Exercises & Solutions Rules

Exercises must:

- Increase in difficulty.
- Reflect production scenarios.
- Avoid trivial questions.

Solutions must:

- Explain reasoning.
- Discuss trade-offs.
- Include runnable code when relevant.

---

## 🏗 Code Standards

- Java 17+
- Clean, minimal examples
- No unnecessary frameworks
- Keep focus on understanding fundamentals

---

## 📊 Production Mindset

This course is not focused on interview tricks.

Each contribution should answer:

- What breaks in production?
- How do we detect it?
- How do we fix it?
- What trade-offs are introduced?

---

## 🔁 Pull Request Process

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch.
3. Follow module template strictly.
4. Include clear commit messages.
5. Submit PR with explanation of architectural value.

---

## 🚫 What Will Be Rejected

- Low-depth explanations
- Missing solutions
- No trade-off discussion
- Overuse of frameworks hiding fundamentals
- AI-generated content without review
