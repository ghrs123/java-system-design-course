# Architecture Templates

This directory is intended for reusable architecture templates:

- High-level diagrams for common patterns (e.g. request/response, CQRS, multi-region).
- Checklists for non-functional requirements (latency, availability, cost, observability).

Templates can be provided as Markdown, Mermaid diagrams, or small reference projects.
