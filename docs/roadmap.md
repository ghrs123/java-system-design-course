# Course Roadmap

This document summarizes the learning path for the **Java System Design Course**.

The course is organized into four levels, each with concrete modules and mini-projects.

---

## Level 1 – Foundations

Focus: understand internals and how things actually work.

- **Module 1 – HTTP Internals**
- **Module 2 – JVM & Concurrency**
- **Module 3 – Database Fundamentals**
- **Module 4 – Caching Strategies**

---

## Level 2 – Scaling Services

Focus: scale services and data stores.

- **Module 1 – Load Balancing**
- **Module 2 – Database Scaling**
- **Module 3 – Messaging & Event-Driven Systems**
- **Module 4 – CAP Theorem & Consistency**

---

## Level 3 – Distributed Systems in Practice

Focus: coordination, resilience and observability across services.

- **Module 1 – SAGA Pattern**
- **Module 2 – Resilience (Retry, Circuit Breaker, Backpressure)**
- **Module 3 – Observability (Logs, Metrics, Traces)**
- **Module 4 – Rate Limiting & Traffic Shaping**

---

## Level 4 – Production Architecture

Focus: global architecture, cost and reliability.

- **Module 1 – Multi-Region Architecture & Failover**
- **Module 2 – Cost Modeling & Capacity Planning**
- **Module 3 – Reliability Engineering (SLA, SLO & Error Budgets)**

## Relationship with Existing Content

The modules above are backed by detailed deep-dive documents in the main repository under `content/level-1` through `content/level-4`, and surfaced in the UI via `client/src/lib/roadmapData.ts`.

This `java-system-design-course/` tree provides a **course-centric layout** (theory, exercises, solutions, projects, code) that can evolve alongside the existing content.
