# Cost Modeling & Capacity Planning – Theory

Key topics:

- Capacity planning (RPS, latency targets, CPU/req, peaks).
- Cost modeling (compute, storage, egress, managed services, observability).
- Simple 3-step model: define load, estimate CPU, add dependencies.

See `content/level-4/cost-modeling-capacity-planning.md` for the full deep-dive.
